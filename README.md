The objective of this project is to further strengthen my JSON and automatic testing skills. It involves three parts:
1.	Implementation of a priority queue with an underlying binary heap implementation
2.	Implement a heapsort using the priority queue
3.	Building a binary heap by reading operations through a JSON file
